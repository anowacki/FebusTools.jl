## Introduction
FebusTools.jl is a Julia package for reading files produced by
[Febus](https://www.febus-optics.com) fibre-optic sensing equipment.

At present, only HDF5 files written by the Febus A1 are read.

## Status of the code
The code is preliminary and in draft form, without tests or
documentation.  You are free to use it, but I cannot offer any
guarantees of its continued maintenance.
